# Hyperelastic Simulation

paper: [Stable Neo-Hookean](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/StableElasticity/paper.pdf), Pixar Animation Studios. An average time step with snh_model took 13.7 Newton iterations, 5,860 Conjugate Gradient (CG) iterations.

As the simulation of flesh requires 118 GB of RAM, it's unfeasible to simulate a body mesh on individual device and I only simulate a cube with snh_model.
